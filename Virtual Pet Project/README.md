Virtual Pet Project:

For this project, the virtual pet, Gary The Snail, has been created.
Gary has 3 properties: Happiness, Hunger, and Energy.
A list of options to choose from have been included.
When one of the options have been selected, some of Gary's properties will be updated.
Using the methods that have been created, the properties will either decrease and/or increase.
If the Tick() method is raised, Happiness, Hunger, and Energy will all go down to 0.
